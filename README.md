## 🚀 Features

- **Operational Core Dashboard** – A sophisticated task management interface with smooth animations and intuitive layout.
- **Neural Engine Analysis** – Gemini-powered strategic summaries of your current workload to identify bottlenecks and priorities.
- **Smart Task Decomposition** – "Neural Break" feature that leverages AI to decompose high-level objectives into actionable sub-directives.
- **Fluent UI Aesthetic** – Premium "Acrylic" and "Mica" glassmorphism effects, Windows 11-inspired "Bloom" background animations, and responsive dark/light modes.
- **Satisfying Life-cycle Animations** – Celebratory "Neural Pop" and success ripples for task completion, and smooth "Collapse-out" exit animations for deletion.
- **Neural Nexus Assistant** – A persistent AI chat assistant with full context of your tasks to help optimize your workflow.
- **Protected Session Management** – Secure Auth context for user profile synchronization and protected routing using React Router.
- **Telemetry & Metrics** – Real-time efficiency index and workload visualization.

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OmkarMishra56/PrismaFlow
```

### 2️⃣ Environment Variables
The application requires a valid Google Gemini API Key. Ensure `process.env.API_KEY` is available in your execution environment.

### 3️⃣ Run the App Locally
Since this project uses ES6 modules directly via import maps in `index.html`, you can serve it using any local web server:

```bash
# Using npx (Static Server)
npx serve .
```

## 🧠 AI Integration Details

PrismaFlow leverages the **Gemini 3 Flash** model to provide real-time intelligence:

- **Strategic Summarization**: Analyzes the `Priority`, `DueDate`, and `Status` of all tasks to generate a high-level executive summary.
- **Structural Decomposition**: Uses `responseSchema` to force the model to return a valid JSON array of subtasks, ensuring UI stability.
- **Contextual Awareness**: The `AIAssistant` is initialized with a `systemInstruction` containing a flattened string of the user's current workload, allowing for personalized productivity advice.
